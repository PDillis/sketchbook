# Sketchbook Drawings
Sol Lewitt, the renowned conceptual artist, gave us the famed [*Wall Drawing*](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) series. In these, simple guidelines were given to his assistants to bring his ideas to the real world, giving us a taste of the current conversation regarding the use of AI tools nowadays, [much to many artists' chagrin](https://berlinartweek.de/en/article/a-shortcut-to-acceptance/).

While anyone with the desire and space to do so can reproduce these *Wall Drawings*, these were usually meant to be brought to life in large spaces, to be appreciated both at a distance and up close. In a way, this limits who can serve as a new "assistant" to Lewitt, even after years of his passing. 

The appearance of large *foundational* models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought forth a new era in our interaction with data. Concretely, the *Wall Drawings* themselves can be seen as instances we wish to either extend or better understand, in particular to how an entity interprets and executes them. Which entity should be the interpreter: the LLM or the human in this process of creation?

Amy Goodchild chose the former: she tasked`ChatGPT` with [generating some the *Wall Drawings*](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/chatgpt-sol-lewitt-wall-drawings) (and later [compared it with the more capable `GPT-4`](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/ai-generations-chatgpt-4-sol-lewitt-wall-drawings)) using nothing but code in [`p5js`](https://p5js.org/). 

Note that, doing so, we're using complex tools to interpret simple instructions, and I feel the roles should be reversed: what if we let the LLM generate ***new*** simple instructions, effectively ***extending*** the Drawings themselves, and let humans do both the interpretation and its execution?

We start now by showcasing some new *Wall Drawings* that `GPT-4` has wrought before moving on to the *Sketchbook Drawings*. Note that this is an ongoing work and that you can find the full conversation log and extra attempts at *Drawings* [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/fdb41e97-ad72-47af-a342-b7ce85ff4b7d) (as of August 11th 2023, but will be continuously updated).

# Extending *Wall Drawings*
Note that it is a hard task to give, so this exercise helped gauge how much freedom we should give to `GPT-4` when creating the newer *Sketchbook Drawings*. There were no instructions on which number to start the *Wall Drawings* from, so this bias may come from the training data itself.

We start with a very vanilla attempt:
> *Wall Drawing 123*: "A wall divided into a grid of nine equal squares, three by three. Each square contains a unique geometric shape. The shapes are to be drawn using only straight lines. The lines within each shape must intersect at least once. The shapes must not repeat and each must touch at least one edge of its square."

A bit boring, but we could do better by specifying that the drawer should use only lines, avoid phrases such as "spaced evenly apart" and "...left to the discretion of the drawer" (or it would be too on the nose), we arrive to:

> *Wall Drawing 127*: "A wall divided into two equal halves vertically. The left half is filled with vertical lines of varying thickness and distance apart. The right half is filled with horizontal lines of varying thickness and distance apart. The lines in each half should not intersect or overlap. The thickness and distance of the lines should be determined by the rhythm of a chosen piece of music."

I would be remiss not to state that the last line of *Wall Drawing 127* blew me away and showed me what types of instructions I could expect or wish to generate along the model. I tried now to remove a constraint: what if we don't ask the drawer to divide the wall into bands or areas?

> *Wall Drawing 129*: "On the wall, draw a series of lines that begin at the floor and extend upward. The lines should vary in length, some reaching halfway up the wall, others extending to the ceiling. The thickness of each line should correspond to its length, with longer lines being thicker. The placement and orientation of the lines should evoke the feeling of a forest of trees."

> *Wall Drawing 130*: "Draw lines of varying lengths and thicknesses across the wall, starting from the bottom and reaching upwards. The lines should undulate and weave, creating an impression of a mountain range when viewed from afar. The lines should not intersect, but they may come close, like peaks and valleys in a landscape. The thickness of each line should subtly correspond to its perceived 'height', with 'taller' lines being thicker."

We've arrived to a state we wish `GPT-4` to generate from: infer a final result, but not explicitly state it to the drawer. Let's move on now to the *Sketchbook Drawings*.

# *Sketchbook Drawings*
The task is simple: instead of a wall, we now have only a small piece of paper or a sketchbook, where we will translate the instructions to the drawings ourselves. The unfiltered instructions will be pasted next, but these will be further refined alongside `GPT-4` in order to have a clear direction. Note that, as the number of *Drawing* increases, I am slowly letting `GPT-4` more freedom in a desired ***creative*** direction and no other.

* *Sketchbook Drawing 1*: "Using a pencil, draw a series of circles of varying sizes across the page. Each circle should intersect with at least one other, but no more than three. The intersections should create a sense of depth, as if some circles are behind or in front of others. Shade the circles accordingly to enhance this perception of depth."
* *Sketchbook Drawing 2*: "With a ballpoint pen, begin at the center of the page and draw a continuous line that spirals outward. The line should curve and loop, but never intersect with itself. As the line moves outward, it should become less dense, creating a sense of dispersion. The final loops should barely touch the edges of the page, like whispers fading into silence."
* *Sketchbook Drawing 3*: "Using a pencil, start at the top left corner of the page and draw a series of lines that extend diagonally to the right, each line slightly longer than the last. When a line reaches the edge of the page, begin the next line from the point where the previous line started. Continue this pattern until you reach the bottom right corner of the page. The result should be a series of triangular shapes, creating a sense of perspective and depth."
* *Sketchbook Drawing 4*: "Take the paper and fold it in half vertically. Unfold it, and then fold it in half horizontally. Unfold again. You should now have a paper divided into four quadrants by the creases. Now, fold the top right corner of the paper down so that it touches the intersection of the creases. Repeat this with the bottom left corner. Next, fold the paper diagonally, aligning the top left corner with the bottom right corner. Unfold. Finally, gently crumple the paper into a loose ball, then carefully open it up to reveal a textured, three-dimensional landscape. The creases, folds, and crumples should interact in a way that creates shadows, valleys, and peaks, turning the flat paper into a tactile work of art."
* *Sketchbook Drawing 5*: "Take a small amount of the liquid in your hand or a container. Starting at the top of the page, allow a single drop to fall onto the paper. Observe the way it spreads, the patterns it creates, and the edges it forms. Next, tilt the paper gently in various directions, allowing the liquid to flow and create organic paths across the surface. Let gravity guide the liquid, but you can influence its direction by the angle and speed of your tilts. Once you've created a series of paths, place the paper flat and allow another drop to fall, this time closer to the center. Watch as it interacts with the paths you've created, either merging with them or creating new spaces. Continue this process, alternating between dropping the liquid and tilting the paper, until you feel the composition is complete. Allow the paper to dry, capturing a moment of fluid motion in a static form."
* *Sketchbook Drawing 6*: 
  * **Creating the Liquid**: Begin by mixing equal parts of water and blue ink (or any color of your choice) in a small container. This will give the liquid a vibrant hue. To adjust the viscosity, add a few drops of glycerin or corn syrup. Stir well. The liquid should flow smoothly but with a slightly thicker consistency than water alone.
  * **Drawing with the Liquid**: Dip a dropper or the tip of a brush into the prepared liquid. Starting at the top of the page, release a single drop onto the paper. Observe its behavior: the way it spreads, the patterns it creates, and the edges it forms. Gently tilt the paper in various directions, guiding the liquid to flow and create organic paths. The added viscosity from the glycerin or corn syrup will give the liquid a slower, more controlled movement. Once you've created a series of paths, place the paper flat and release another drop, this time closer to the center. Watch its interaction with the existing paths, either merging or forging new spaces. Continue this process, alternating between releasing the liquid and tilting the paper, until you feel the composition captures the dance of fluidity and control. Allow the paper to dry, preserving the dynamic interplay of color and motion.
* *Sketchbook Drawing 7*: Equip yourself with a sketchbook and a free-flowing pen or pencil. Start walking in an open space, maintaining awareness of your surroundings. As you move, begin by drawing straight lines across the page, letting the natural sway of your walk influence their direction and form. Transition into simple geometric shapes, allowing the rhythm of your steps to morph circles into ovals or squares into trapezoids. If the terrain changes, let that shift be reflected in your drawing. Continue walking and drawing, allowing your conscious decisions to meld with the unpredictability of movement, creating a dynamic record of your journey.
* For *Sketchbook Drawing #8*, position your sketchbook in a place where it can remain undisturbed for a period of time. Choose a location near a window where the sun's rays or the shadows of moving objects can touch the page. Begin by lightly sketching a few base shapes or lines as a reference. As time passes, the sun will move, and shadows will shift across your page. Every half hour or so, trace the shadows or highlight the areas illuminated by the sun. The drawing will evolve as the day progresses, with layers of lines and shapes accumulating. By the end of the day, your sketchbook will hold a visual record of time's passage, with each mark influenced by the specific moments of the day it was made.
* For *Sketchbook Drawing #9*, position yourself in a place with a mix of ambient sounds and scents, perhaps near an open window or in a garden. Close your eyes to focus solely on your other senses. If you detect the aroma of a drink or meal, draw vertical lines of varying lengths, letting the intensity of the scent dictate the length. Should the scent of flowers or plants reach you, sketch gentle wavy lines across the page, allowing the strength of the aroma to influence the amplitude of the waves. For sounds: if you hear the chirping of birds, rotate your sketchbook 45 degrees. The distant hum or buzz of vehicles or machinery should prompt you to draw small, tight circles, with the frequency of the sound determining the number of circles. The rustling of leaves or the sound of wind might inspire you to draw soft, feather-like strokes, with the intensity of the sound guiding the pressure of your drawing tool. By the end of the exercise, your sketchbook will contain a sensory map of your environment, captured through touch and interpreted by sound and smell.
